# Live Git Push

Commit and push local file changes to your remote git repository in real time.

I made it to use on a training, to easy students access changed files quickly, while they are changing.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

    npm install live-git-push -g

Go to your project path and write:

    live-git-push

It will commit and push to remote git repository on every file save.
